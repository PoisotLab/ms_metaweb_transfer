The ms received very positive comments with several points to work on. Please
carefully correct your ms according to those.

### Minor points:

Sm2 page 2: in the title of the second graph/ you wrote "metaweb" ; a letter is
missing.

> Done.

For all figures: please make sure they are colorblind-friendly.

> We've checked all figures to make sure that they are sufficiently contrasting

Could you detail as to why the Newfoundland dataset was used to validate a
canadian metaweb? Is this dataset not already within the canadian metaweb? In
addition, the Newfoundland dataset is based on a litterature review, not on
actual data for Newfoundland and many references use studies outside
Newfoundland itself. How can this affect the results and can we avoid the
pitfalls of using already built datasets extracted from the litterature?

l.21: "recommend" ? I am not sure about this wording. It creates confusion.

> Altered to read 'to infer'.

I know this one will be difficult to implement but since the ms is exceeding the
word count by a widemargin, trying to me more concise would be go a long way
(see also reviewers' comment on this). However it should not be done at the
expanse of clarity in the text. For instance, for all the steps of your
implementation, you could do an insert called "in a nuttshell" where you can
hightlight the steps or transform this into a figure so that readers can easily
and quicky grasp your approach; this will complement figure 1 and the words used
in this "in a nuttshell" insert will not count. Sure, it will not reduce the
volume of the ms but can help with attracting more users of your approach.

## Referee 1

I was reviewer #3 of the previous submission in Ecology Letters and am now
satisfied that the authors have appropriately addressed my earlier concerns in
the revised manuscript.

I have one suggestion related to this revision. 

First, the authors demonstrated that network structures are different between
the European and Canadian metawebs in the additional PCA analysis of several
network structures for both metawebs (Supp. Mat. 3). However, I feel there are
insufficient explanations of this in the main text. Specifically, the difference
between the distributions of the two metawebs appears in the direction of the
PC1. Can this point be interpreted as the difference between the European and
Canadian predatory mammals in the prey menu (or the degree of
specialization/generalization)? Making more explicit such points would help the
ecological interpretation of the results for the readers.

> **@here** Can we argue that the PCA (in this context) isn't for interpretation

> 'homogenization'? But I guess we can expand on that in the supp mat if we

### Minor points:

L196–204: typo (a SVD/a RDPG -> an SVD/ an RDPG?)

> Done

## Referee 2

This manuscript presents a novel method to predict potential trophic
interactions in a region where the species pool is known, but interactions are
unknown. The authors validate and show the usage of the method with a case study
where they assemble a metaweb for Canadian mammals derived from a known European
metaweb. By comparing the predictions with interaction databases, they show that
the method is robust and has a high success rate.

This is a very exciting study that will surely be of wide interest among
ecologists. I have read all the submitted material, including the earlier
reviews, and consider that the authors have answered all concerns from previous
reviewers. Most criticism seems to come from the expectation that the study
would present predictions of local food webs, probably stemming from a
misunderstanding of the concept of a metaweb, which the authors have clearly
stated in the main text (at least in the current version). My comments are
mainly suggestions to improve clarity in the text.

Does the phylogenetic transfer require a single phylogenetic tree? I’m thinking
about bipartite networks of two very distant clades (that’s my bias) but also
food webs that contain distantly related groups of species. Would you have to
make a big supertree or could you use one tree for each latent subspace, for
example? I’m mainly curious about this, but I’m sure there will be more readers
asking themselves the same thing, so it might be worth it to address it in the
discussion.

> An excellent question and something we have addressed now in-text as well (ln.
> 298-299) In short, we don't necessarily need to use one super tree and (*e.g.*
> for bipartite webs) two distinct trees can be used. Trait
> reconstruction/prediction could then be performed separately for the two
> clades.

### Minor points:

End of point 2 in abstract: “… construct AN interaction matrix”

> Done

Line 3, point 4 of abstract: typo in “framework”

> Done

Line 36: I think I understand what you mean, but it might be worth it to clarify
at which scale the phylogenetic signal is retained, in comparison with the
community scale where the signal might not be detectable.

> Rephrased as 'retain this signal even if it becomes **obscured** at the
> community scale due to *e.g.* local conditions...' (ln. 28-29) to emphasize
> that at smaller scales we might expect random chance/local conditions to cause
> some re-wiring but the evolutionary history still remains. Hopefully this
> slight rephrasing aids in clarity.

Line 140: “disconnected from A model”? If “the" is correct, then which model?

> Done

Lines 161-162: I find this sentence confusing. Maybe that’s because I’m not
familiar with RDPG. But consider switching the order to “RDPG is known to
capture the evolutionary backbone of food webs, resulting in strong phylogenetic
signal in RDPG results”.

> Reworded as recommended

Line 180: typo in “whith” 

> Done

Line 212: “adding OR removing”

> Done

Line 276: Figure 4 is only cited in the discussion. Would be helpful to put it
into context in the main text. Also, what’s the rank in the x-axis in the left
panel?

> **TODO** clarify rank of left panel and update caption to contextualize

Paragraphs 298-308 and 310-315 are quite redundant. I suggest reducing one of
them.

> An excellent point. Opting for brevity we have combined and compressed these
> two paragraphs into one - keeping it in the methods section.

Line 317: “Fig. 6” with capital F

> Done

Lines 335-337: Add “past” somewhere, e.g. “the signal of both past climate
change…”  

> Done

Line 401: I’d replace the “Although”. It sounds too contrasting, as if one of
the results wasn’t that good, which is not true. Maybe “While” is better.

> Done

Line 444: “All editors” should be “All authors”?

> Done

Figure 3: That was a tricky figure for me. I missed information about the color
scales and the row and columns of all the matrices.

> **@here** I guess this becomes conceptually a bit 'tricky' since we are
> working in 'latent' space as opposed to something tangible. Although maybe a
> note on colour saturation could help? **yes**

Figure 6: Which differences in z-score? This is not mentioned anywhere else, so
it’s very hard to follow.

> **@here** Should we add something about the MaxEnt configuration model for
> clarity? **no** 

S.M.2, line 3: missing e in “average”

> Done

S.M.2, first paragraph: wouldn't it be simpler to write “95% confidence interval
around μ divided by 3.92”?

> **@here** - thoughts? **sure**

Figures in S.M: Would be easier to follow (and review) if the figures had
numbers and were cited in the text.

> **@here** thoughts? **due to length constraints, no + figures in the S.M. need the context of their accompanying text, which we cite**

S.M.2, first figure: What’s the color scale showing?

> **@here** Am I right in saying that this is the 'density'/number of
> interactions/prediction for that specific bin (where bin is the combo if the
> uniform and normal score) **yes**

S.M.3, first paragraph: “We selected a random subset of 300 rows from the
network-property matrix”. Does this mean you used 300 of the 400 random
subgraphs to fit the PCA?

> **@here** **probably**
