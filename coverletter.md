Dear members of the Ecology Letters editorial board,

On behalf of my co-authors, I am pleased to submit our manuscript entitled “Food web
reconstruction through phylogenetic transfer of low-rank network representation”
for publication as a Methods article in Ecology Letters. We had previously discussed the
submission of this manuscript with Prof. Tim Coulson.

A central issue within the field of network ecology is that datasets on species
interactions (and the resulting networks) are incomplete and unevenly
distributed. This presents a major bottleneck to develop an
understanding of networks across large spatial scales. The challenge of
sampling interactions also makes data collection often non-viable and has led to the
development of a suite of methods that focus on addressing *incompleteness*
within *known* networks. However, these methods are limited in their capacity to
begin address existing *gaps*, *i.e.* unkown interactions in unsampled places.
In this manuscript we present a methodological
framework that will allow us to move forward and begin filling these gaps.

This framework is built on the premise of transfer learning whereby we can focus
on the information (species interaction data) that we do have and 'bring it
with us' (through various statistical methods) to an area where this information is lacking.
We achive this by learning a representation of the known network through graph embedding
and transferring what we have learnt about how those species interact through a
suitable medium (phylogeny) and using this to predict how species in the target location
might interact. We discuss this framework by inferring and
constructing the metaweb for Canadian terrestrial mammals using the European
metaweb as the knowledge source - despite the fact that these two regions share
only 4% of species.

The manuscript is complemented by a series of online and annotated notebooks
that aid in explanation and provide readers with a starting point for
implementation in their own work. Of note is that entire workflow can be run on
a laptop in a matter of minutes making this an accessible option for a broad
range of end users. The flexibility and low computational cost of this transfer
learning framework makes it of interest and applicability to a wide range of
scenarios and potential usages. We envisage this workflow as a starting point in
beginning to fill in the spatial gaps and facilitate thinking about species
interaction networks over large spatial scales, but could also have applicability
within network theory (*e.g.* extinction cascades) or pertaining to conservation
scenarios.

This manuscript builds on previous works of the authors. Namely, we present
a concrete application of noveal approaches to network prediction outlined in Strydom
et al. (2021), use the European metaweb developed by Maiorano et al. (2020), and
draw on works that highlight the applicability of singular value decomposition
within network ecology (Strydom, Dalla Riva and Poisot 2021) and network
prediction (Poisot et al. 2021; Runghen, Stouffer and Dalla Riva 2021).

The work described here has not been published elsewhere. All authors agree with
the the manuscript content and its submission to the journal. No part of this
manuscript has been published in any form elsewhere or is being considered for
publication elsewhere while it is being considered for publication in this
journal. This manuscript appeared as a preprint on EcoEvoRXiV with the following DOI: XXXXX.

We look forward to your editorial decision on this manuscript.
