**Salutation to  Tim Coulson**,

Please consider the attached manuscript entitled “Food web reconstruction
through phylogenetic transfer of low-rank network representation” for
publication as a Methods contribution in Ecology Letters.

A central issue within the field of network ecology is the limited (and
spatially biased) availability of data on species interactions. This presents a
major bottle neck for attempting to develop an understanding of networks across
large spatial scales. The inherit challenge of sampling interactions has lead to
the development of a suite of methods that focus on addressing incompleteness
within known networks. However we still lack a way to predict interactions for a
location where there are no interaction data available, meaning that we are
unable to address existing spatial gaps and biases.

In this manuscript we address this problem by providing a framework that allows
us to construct a metaweb for a given species pool without having had any prior
interaction data. This framework is built upon the notion of transfer learning
and allows us to *learn* the network representation of a known network and
*transfer* this to the target (interactions unknown) species pool. The framework
itself is flexible and can be altered to better suit the specific learning
problem. We breakdown and present this framework using the European metaweb to
infer and construct the metaweb for Canadian terrestrial mammals using the
mammalian phylogenetic structure as a medium for transfer. The manuscript is
complemented by a series of online and annotated notebooks that aid in
explanation and provide readers with a starting point for implementation in
their own work. Of note is that entire workflow can be implemented and run on a
laptop in a matter of minutes making this an accessible workflow to implement.

The flexibility and low computational cost of this transfer learning framework
makes it of interest and applicability to a wide range of scenarios and
potential usages. We envisage this workflow as a starting point in beginning to
fill in the spatial gaps and facilitate thinking about species interaction
networks over large spatial scales.

<!-- Additionally, the covering letter should include a clear statement of exactly
how the present manuscript is outstandingly novel relative to recent work by the
author or coauthors cited in the present submission. -->

<!--  Talk about how this is sort of a coming to head of things. Strydom et al. 2021
discusses *within* network methods. GVDRs RDPG/Backbone work lays the
groundwork. --->
