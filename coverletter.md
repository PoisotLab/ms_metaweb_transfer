# Cover letter

**Greetings**,

On behalf of my co-authors find attached our manuscript entitled “Food web
reconstruction through phylogenetic transfer of low-rank network representation”
for publication as a Methods contribution in Ecology Letters.

A central issue within the field of network ecology is that datasets on species
interactions (and the resulting networks) are incomplete and unevenly
distributed. This presents a major bottle neck for attempting to develop an
understanding of networks across large spatial scales. The inherit challenge of
sampling interactions makes data collection non-viable and has lead to the
development of a suite of methods that focus on addressing *incompleteness*
within *known* networks. However, these methods are limited in their capacity to
begin filling in the *gaps*. In this manuscript we present a methodological
framework that will allow us to begin addressing these gaps.

This framework is built on the premise of transfer learning whereby we can focus
on the information (species interaction data) that we do have in one area and
'bring it with us' to an area for which we have no interaction data. This is
achieved by learning the network representation of the known network through
graph embedding and transferring what we have learnt about how those species
interact and using this to predict how species in the target location might
interact. We breakdown and present this framework using the European metaweb to
infer and construct the metaweb for Canadian terrestrial mammals despite sharing
only 4% of species.

The manuscript is complemented by a series of online and annotated notebooks
that aid in explanation and provide readers with a starting point for
implementation in their own work. Of note is that entire workflow can be
implemented and run on a laptop in a matter of minutes making this an accessible
to a broad range of end users. The flexibility and low computational cost of
this transfer learning framework makes it of interest and applicability to a
wide range of scenarios and potential usages. We envisage this workflow as a
starting point in beginning to fill in the spatial gaps and facilitate thinking
about species interaction networks over large spatial scales but could also have
applicability within network theory (*e.g.* extinction cascades) or pertaining
to conservation scenarios.

<!--  Still rocky on this.... --->
This manuscript builds on (and brings together) previous works, namely we
further the discussion of network prediction outlined in Strydom et al. (2021),
use the European metaweb developed by Maiorano et al. (2020), and draw on the
discussions on the applicability of singular value decomposition within network
ecology (Strydom, Dalla Riva and Poisot 2021) and network prediction (Poisot et
al. 2021 and Runghen, Stouffer and Dalla Riva 2021).

The work described here has not been published elsewhere. All authors agree with
the the manuscript content and its submission to the journal. No part of this
manuscript has been published in any form elsewhere or is being considered for
publication elsewhere while it is being considered for publication in this
journal.
